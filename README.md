# Earthquake Data Visualizations with Leaflet 

Interactive map and visualizations that visualize global power plants and green house gas emissions by country. 

## Description

We looked at data from various countries detailing greenhouse gas emissions as well as power plant information.

Data includes:

Types of emissions per country per year.

Individual power plantâ€™s location and fuel type.

Total emissions per year.

Total amount of power (gwh) generated per year.
