# Earthquake Data Visualizations with Leaflet 

Interactive map and visualizations that visualize global power plants and green house gas emissions by country. 

## Description

We looked at data from various countries detailing greenhouse gas emissions as well as power plant information.

Data includes:

Types of emissions per country per year.

Individual power plantâ€™s location and fuel type.

Total emissions per year.

Total amount of power (gwh) generated per year.


**Interactive Leaflet Map:**

Interactivate Leaflet map showing the location and information about all the globale power plants. They are color coded based on whether they use clean or dirty sources to generate energy: green for clean and grey for dirty.

**Clean vs. Dirty Power Plant Breakdown:**

Pie chart displaying the breakdown of clean vs. dirty energy power plants. When the website is first launched, it displays the global totals. The chart updates to just a country level breakdown when the user chooses a country.

**Historic GHG Emissions:**

Chart displaying greenhouse gas emissions over time. Global totals on launch and adjusts to country level when user chooses a country.

**Energy Producted by Power Plants:**

Shows total energy produced by clean and dirty energy sources. It includes estimated and recorded values. Global totals on launch and adjusts to country level when user chooses a country.

**Power Plant Breakdown by Energy Type:**

Radar chart demonstrating the breakdown of every power plant energy type. Global totals on launch and adjusts to country level when user chooses a country.
